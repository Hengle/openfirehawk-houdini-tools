# openfirehawk-houdini-tools

A collection of useful hda's and scripts used in the Open Firehawk VFX pipeline.  I've you find this useful and would like to support its evolution reach out to contribute to the repo or you can support the work on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/openfirehawk

Many of these tools are still a work in progress and not ready for production.  they represent the current state in my own workflows.

If you commit any changes please commit to the dev branch.

To use this you will need to clone this repo into your houdini package path, and copy the .json package file from here up one level into your packages directory.
